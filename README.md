# Production Planning Optimization for Quantum Corporation

## Problem Overview
Quantum Corporation faces a challenge in balancing production capacity, labor costs, and inventory management due to seasonal demand for its action toy series. The company must develop a production plan that minimizes costs while meeting demand over a 12-month period.

## Approach
I used **Excel Solver** and **basic IF functions** to calculate the optimal production strategy, ensuring that Quantum Corporation can meet demand while minimizing production, overtime, subcontracting, and inventory holding costs.

### Excel Solver Configuration
The goal of this analysis is to determine the number of workers required each month and the appropriate use of overtime and subcontracting to minimize total costs.

1. **Objective Function**: Minimize total cost, which includes regular production costs, overtime costs, subcontracting costs, inventory holding costs, and labor adjustment costs (hiring/firing).
2. **Decision Variables**:
   - Number of workers required each month.
   - Cases produced via regular production, overtime, and subcontracting.
   - Inventory levels at the end of each month.
3. **Constraints**:
   - Production (regular + overtime + subcontracting) must meet or exceed demand.
   - Overtime production is capped at 300 cases per month.
   - Each worker can produce 100 cases per month.
   - No stockouts are allowed.

### Logic Implemented with IF Functions
I used **IF functions** in Excel to handle key production decisions and constraints:
- **Regular Production**: If regular production capacity exceeds demand, calculate surplus for inventory.
- **Overtime**: If demand exceeds regular production capacity, allocate up to 300 cases for overtime production.
- **Subcontracting**: If demand still exceeds the combined regular and overtime production, allocate the remaining demand to subcontracting.
- **Inventory Holding**: Use IF functions to calculate holding costs based on ending inventory each month.
- **Workforce Adjustments**: Calculate hiring or firing costs based on changes in workforce size month-to-month.

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Demand Analysis**: Analyze the demand for each month and set the production targets.
2. **Regular Production**: Determine the number of workers needed each month based on regular production limits (100 cases/worker).
3. **Overtime and Subcontracting**: Use IF functions to handle overflow demand. If demand exceeds regular production, overtime is used first (up to 300 cases), followed by subcontracting if necessary.
4. **Inventory Calculation**: Track ending inventory based on excess production in months where demand is lower than production capacity.
5. **Cost Calculation**: Calculate total costs, including:
   - Regular production cost
   - Overtime cost
   - Subcontracting cost
   - Inventory holding cost
   - Workforce adjustment costs (hiring and firing)
6. **Optimization with Solver**: Use Excel Solver to minimize total cost by adjusting the number of workers, overtime, and subcontracting while ensuring all constraints are met.

## Results

After applying **Excel Solver** to optimize the production plan, I achieved the following:

## Cost Breakdown:
- Regular Production: $10 per case
- Overtime Production: $15 per case
- Subcontracting: $25 per case
- Hiring Workers: $1,000 per worker
- Firing Workers: $500 per worker
- Inventory Holding Cost: $1 per case per month

## Conclusion

I compared the results for three different production planning scenarios to provide management with valuable insights.

1. **Level Production over 12 Months**:
   - In this scenario, I calculated a constant monthly production level to meet demand, without varying production levels from month to month. The total cost was $1,320,000.
   - The challenge with this approach is that inventory levels fluctuated drastically in months with higher or lower demand, leading to higher holding and stockout costs in certain months.

2. **Produce to Meet Demand Each Month**:
   - This scenario involved aligning production exactly with demand each month. The total cost was $1,170,000.
   - It minimized inventory holding costs and reduced stockout costs, but required a higher number of workers in months with higher demand, leading to increased labor costs.

3. **Linear Programming (LP) Using Excel Solver**:
   - By solving the problem using **Excel Solver**, I found the optimal production strategy that balanced regular production, overtime, and subcontracting while minimizing costs. The total cost was **$142,500**.
   - This approach resulted in the lowest overall cost by using regular production as the base, employing overtime when demand exceeded capacity, and subcontracting only when necessary.
   - Solver efficiently adjusted labor costs (hiring/firing) and production rates, ensuring no stockouts while maintaining low overall costs.

### Comparison of Scenarios:
- **Level Production**: Total cost = $1,320,000
- **Produce to Meet Demand**: Total cost = $1,170,000
- **Linear Programming Using Solver**: Total cost = **$142,500**

### Final Result:
- **Lowest Total Cost**: The linear programming approach using **Excel Solver** provided the most cost-effective solution at **$142,500**.
- **Most Efficient**: This strategy achieved the optimal balance between labor, production, and inventory, ensuring no stockouts and minimizing overtime and subcontracting costs.

By employing Excel Solver, I optimized the production plan and delivered the lowest cost solution, meeting both the seasonal demand and the company's strategic goals.
